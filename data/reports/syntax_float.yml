query:
  - "UNWIND [0]+[] AS i RETURN toBoolean(i)"
report_message: |
  When running the following query against an empty database:
  
  ```cypher
  UNWIND [0]+[] AS i RETURN toBoolean(i)
  ```
  
  I encountered the following error:
  ```
  Type mismatch: expected Boolean, Integer or String but was Float (line 1, column 37 (offset: 36))
  "UNWIND [0]+[] AS i RETURN toBoolean(i)"
                                       ^
  ```
  
  I believe the query mentioned above is semantically and syntactically correct and thus no error should be thrown here.
  Additionally, alternatives that evaluate to the same query don't throw an error, like for example:
  `UNWIND [0] AS i RETURN toBoolean(i)` or
  `UNWIND []+[0] AS i RETURN toBoolean(i)` or
  `RETURN toBoolean(0)`
  
  I encountered this issue when testing queries against the **Neo4j 5.5.0 community version** in a Docker container running **alpine v.3**.
  
  ### Steps to reproduce
  Run the following query and observe it throws an error:
  ```cypher
  UNWIND [0]+[] AS i RETURN toBoolean(i)
  ```
  
  ### Expected behavior
  The query should run successfully
  
  ### Actual behavior
  The query fails with the error message `Type mismatch: expected Boolean, Integer or String but was Float...`
