report_message: |
  When running the following query against an empty database:
  
  ```cypher
  RETURN null ORDER BY properties(CASE WHEN null THEN null END)
  ```
  
  I encountered the following error:
  ```
  Type mismatch: expected Map, Node or Relationship but was Boolean (line 1, column 33 (offset: 32))
  "RETURN null ORDER BY properties(CASE WHEN null THEN null END)"
                                   ^
  ```
  
  I believe the aforementioned query is semantically and syntactially correct and thus no error should be thrown here.
  Additionally, alternatives that use the same syntax constructs or evaluate to the same query don't throw an error, like for example:
  `RETURN properties(CASE WHEN null THEN null END)` or
  `RETURN null ORDER BY properties(CASE WHEN false THEN null END)` or
  `RETURN null ORDER BY properties(null)`
  
  
  I encountered this issue when testing queries against the **Neo4j 5.5.0 community version** in a Docker container running **alpine v.3**.
  
  ### Steps to reproduce
  Run the following query and observe it throws an error:
  ```cypher
  RETURN null ORDER BY properties(CASE WHEN null THEN null END)
  ```
  
  ### Expected behavior
  The query should run successfully
  
  ### Actual behavior
  The query fails with the error message `Type mismatch: expected Map, Node or Relationship but was Boolean...`
