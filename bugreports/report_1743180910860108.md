When running the following query:
```cypher
MATCH (:qv7cWuT1{Y:(1939067803119102284)}), () WHERE (null) UNWIND ((null)+[]) AS Mm0uKC WITH  *, null AS X  SKIP (6414933120865981198)  OPTIONAL MATCH (:qv7cWuT1:qv7cWuT1:qv7cWuT1:qv7cWuT1{mTB:(true)})<-[bv3a:boP]-(J7w8) MATCH (QC_j{Cp3GGHz:(""), BcQ_qNibtg:(""+(("K[%"))), KiBuA1:(9223372036854775807), bww13:(true)}) WHERE toBoolean((true)) WITH DISTINCT *, null AS eQ    UNWIND null AS NAHCZnr WITH * WITH  null AS cGL  SKIP (0)  WITH DISTINCT startNode(null) AS sQsAp0BX  SKIP (6298948950655693361) LIMIT (1) UNWIND (CASE size([]) WHEN 1 THEN [] ELSE [CASE WHEN (true) THEN null WHEN (true) THEN null   END] END) AS k34Oih3Cr WITH  startNode(null) AS pH, keys((CASE WHEN (null) IS NULL THEN null WHEN (null) IS NOT NULL then (null) WHEN (true) THEN null  ELSE null END)) AS TkKm, null AS t ORDER BY (false) DESC, null DESC, null DESC SKIP (0)   FOREACH (JL IN [] | MERGE dzeotX9u = (:qv7cWuT1:qv7cWuT1)-[:JiT{tqCg0Pvzz:(7487233956485785147), G7R:(false)}]->(kk:qv7cWuT1:qv7cWuT1:qv7cWuT1:qv7cWuT1)   ) RETURN  (0) AS rS0b  SKIP (1) LIMIT (1)
```

I encountered the following error:
```
Neo4jError: Memgraph.ClientError.MemgraphError.MemgraphError (MATCH can't be put after OPTIONAL MATCH.)
```

I believe the query mentioned above is semantically and syntactically correct and thus no error should be thrown here.

I encountered this issue when testing queries against a locally compiled instance of the memgraph master branch in a Docker container running **debian bullseye**.

### Steps to reproduce
Run the following queries and observe it throws an error:
```cypher
MATCH (:qv7cWuT1{Y:(1939067803119102284)}), () WHERE (null) UNWIND null AS Mm0uKC WITH  *  SKIP (6414933120865981198)  MATCH (QC_j{Cp3GGHz:(""), BcQ_qNibtg:("K[%"), KiBuA1:(9223372036854775807), bww13:(true)}) WHERE toBoolean((true)) WITH DISTINCT *    UNWIND null AS NAHCZnr WITH  null AS cGL  SKIP (0)  WITH DISTINCT startNode(null) AS sQsAp0BX  SKIP (6298948950655693361) LIMIT (1) WITH  startNode(null) AS pH, keys(null) AS TkKm, null AS t ORDER BY (false) DESC, null DESC, null DESC SKIP (0)   RETURN  (0) AS rS0b  SKIP (1) LIMIT (1)

```

### Expected behavior
The query should run successfully

### Actual behavior
The query fails with the error message `Neo4jError: Memgraph.ClientError.MemgraphError.MemgraphError (MATCH can't be put after OPTIONAL MATCH.)`
