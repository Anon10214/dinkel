When running the following query:
```cypher
WITH  null AS e61sYiiG, null AS kof    MATCH (:Q) WHERE (true) CALL {  RETURN  (2967131580064048734) AS Yl, ("3") AS I, (null) AS Qi8U, min((7226618740681675774)) AS Gf, null AS prPRNjU2H2, (0) AS G2L, (null) AS xMt3EN1    } MERGE vshR = (GTNW37:Q)   MERGE CM9wE = (GTNW37)<-[IKk1Nk6dt3:Q{SbzVN57Qoo:(false)}]-(:Q{XtsMLDjxuT:(7133361793257493516)})-[:iXKqG6wK{iJ:(3032980834752370775), qj5w9zA:(-2938951814902376615)}]->(GTNW37)   
```

My memgraph instance crashes due to a segfault.

I encountered this issue when testing queries against a locally compiled instance of the memgraph master branch in a Docker container running **debian bullseye**.

### Steps to reproduce
Run the following queries and observe the database crashes:
```cypher
OPTIONAL MATCH (:Rw397:Q) WHERE (true)    CREATE (KR6C9:Q:Q:Q:Q)-[iNUiGf:Q]->(KR6C9)-[Ei_AGYHDG:iXKqG6wK{kGE:("QKpBh")}]->(:Q) 
---
  MERGE NUFOx = (VK31:Q{_sZHFgBDL2:("1"), _mMLxgdQ:(1)})   
---
WITH  null AS e61sYiiG, null AS kof    MATCH (:Q) WHERE (true) CALL {  RETURN  (2967131580064048734) AS Yl, ("3") AS I, (null) AS Qi8U, min((7226618740681675774)) AS Gf, null AS prPRNjU2H2, (0) AS G2L, (null) AS xMt3EN1    } MERGE vshR = (GTNW37:Q)   MERGE CM9wE = (GTNW37)<-[IKk1Nk6dt3:Q{SbzVN57Qoo:(false)}]-(:Q{XtsMLDjxuT:(7133361793257493516)})-[:iXKqG6wK{iJ:(3032980834752370775), qj5w9zA:(-2938951814902376615)}]->(GTNW37)

---
  MERGE NUFOx = (VK31:Q{_sZHFgBDL2:("1"), _mMLxgdQ:(1)})   
---
WITH  null AS e61sYiiG, null AS kof    MATCH (:Q) WHERE (true) CALL {  RETURN  (2967131580064048734) AS Yl, ("3") AS I, (null) AS Qi8U, min((7226618740681675774)) AS Gf, null AS prPRNjU2H2, (0) AS G2L, (null) AS xMt3EN1    } MERGE vshR = (GTNW37:Q)   MERGE CM9wE = (GTNW37)<-[IKk1Nk6dt3:Q{SbzVN57Qoo:(false)}]-(:Q{XtsMLDjxuT:(7133361793257493516)})-[:iXKqG6wK{iJ:(3032980834752370775), qj5w9zA:(-2938951814902376615)}]->(GTNW37)   
```

### Expected behavior
The query should run successfully

### Actual behavior
The query crashes the database.
