When running the following query:
```cypher
 CREATE hoIU = (ZcNzH2th:_YOT:_YOT:_YOT:_YOT) DETACH DELETE ZcNzH2th WITH * REMOVE ZcNzH2th.K8, ZcNzH2th.K8 
```

I encountered the following error:
```
Neo4jError: Memgraph.ClientError.MemgraphError.MemgraphError (Trying to remove a property on a deleted graph element.)
```

I believe the query mentioned above is semantically and syntactically correct and thus no error should be thrown here.

I encountered this issue when testing queries against a locally compiled instance of the memgraph master branch in a Docker container running **debian bullseye**.

### Steps to reproduce
Run the following queries and observe it throws an error:
```cypher
 CREATE hoIU = (ZcNzH2th:_YOT:_YOT:_YOT:_YOT) DETACH DELETE ZcNzH2th REMOVE ZcNzH2th.K8 
---
 CREATE hoIU = (ZcNzH2th:_YOT:_YOT:_YOT:_YOT) DETACH DELETE ZcNzH2th WITH * REMOVE ZcNzH2th.K8, ZcNzH2th.K8 
```

### Expected behavior
The query should run successfully

### Actual behavior
The query fails with the error message `Neo4jError: Memgraph.ClientError.MemgraphError.MemgraphError (Trying to remove a property on a deleted graph element.)`
