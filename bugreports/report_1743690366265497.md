When running the following query:
```cypher
UNWIND [(false), none(IkjfmNHWfp IN [] WHERE null), (false)] AS Tk     RETURN  max((false)) AS _vNBIIZuY, (":") AS r7V, (false) AS UF7hX, (false) AS j_mpxBtTx, (true) AS lv, null AS XVLKVfd, (null) AS LGAkv   LIMIT (487376597548866638)
```

I encountered the following error:
```
Neo4jError: Memgraph.ClientError.MemgraphError.MemgraphError (Unable to get MAX of 'bool' and 'bool'.)
```

I believe the query mentioned above is semantically and syntactically correct and thus no error should be thrown here.

I encountered this issue when testing queries against a locally compiled instance of the memgraph master branch in a Docker container running **debian bullseye**.

### Steps to reproduce
Run the following queries and observe it throws an error:
```cypher
UNWIND [(false), none(IkjfmNHWfp IN [] WHERE null), (false)] AS Tk     RETURN  max((false)) AS _vNBIIZuY, (":") AS r7V, (false) AS UF7hX, (false) AS j_mpxBtTx, (true) AS lv, null AS XVLKVfd, (null) AS LGAkv   LIMIT (487376597548866638)
---
UNWIND [(false), none(IkjfmNHWfp IN [] WHERE null), (false)] AS Tk     RETURN  max((false)) AS _vNBIIZuY, (":") AS r7V, (false) AS UF7hX, (false) AS j_mpxBtTx, (true) AS lv, null AS XVLKVfd, (null) AS LGAkv   LIMIT (487376597548866638)
```

### Expected behavior
The query should run successfully

### Actual behavior
The query fails with the error message `Neo4jError: Memgraph.ClientError.MemgraphError.MemgraphError (Unable to get MAX of 'bool' and 'bool'.)`
